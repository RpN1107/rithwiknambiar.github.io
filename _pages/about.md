I am currently pursuing a master's in Biological Data Science from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Tirupati , with a background in molecular biology and a passion for turning complex biological questions into data-driven insights. I started my academic journey with a 5-year integrated master’s in Biology from IISER Thiruvananthapuram, where I gained a strong foundation in cellular and molecular biology. My experience in wet-lab research inspired me to explore computational approaches to biological discovery.

    <strong>Why Bioinformatics?</strong><br>
    During my research experience in molecular biology, I was drawn to the potential of bioinformatics and data science in understanding biological systems at scale. The ability to analyze large-scale omics datasets, build predictive models, and develop data-driven hypotheses has since become the focus of my work.

## Outside the Lab

I enjoy singing, reading whatever I can get my hands on, getting up to speed with what is happening in every sport there is, playing football and exploring creative ways to communicate science.
