I am currently pursuing a master's in Biological Data Science, with a background in molecular biology and a passion for turning complex biological questions into data-driven insights. I started my academic journey with a 5-year integrated master’s in Biology from the Indian Insitute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram, where I gained a strong foundation in cellular and molecular biology. My experience in wet-lab research inspired me to explore computational approaches to biological discovery.

## Why Bioinformatics?

During my research experience in molecular biology, I was drawn to the potential of bioinformatics and data science in understanding biological systems at scale. The ability to analyze large-scale omics datasets, build predictive models, and develop data-driven hypotheses has since become the focus of my work.

## Research Interests

- **Mitochondrial Biology** – Exploring the metabolic hub and the powerhouse of the cell
- **Machine learning in biology** – Apply machine learning and deep learning to understand complex biological systems
- **Multi-omics integration** – Combining genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics

## Skills & Tools

- **Experimental**: Molecular Cloning, Western Blotting, Protein Expression and Purification, Immunofluorescence,
Fluorescence Microscopy, DNA/RNA isolation, Yeast Genetics, Yeast Cell Culture, Mammalian Cell Culture,
Affinity Purification
- **Languages**: R , Python , Bash , MATLAB , Perl
- **Computational skills**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Flux Balance Analysis, Dynamic Modelling,
Constraint-Based Modelling, Bulk and scRNA Seq, Genome-Wide Association Studies
- **Softwares**: Colab, RStudio, Cytoscape, GraphPad, Origin, ImageLab, QuantityOne, ImageJ

## Outside the Lab

I enjoy singing, reading whatever I can get my hands on, getting upto speed with what is happening in every sport there is, playing football and exploring creative ways to communicate science.
