## 💡 Why Computational Biology?

Biology is increasingly data-driven, with sequencing, proteomics, and imaging producing vast datasets that demand computational insight.  
My dual training in wet-lab and computational biology enables me to **bridge experimental biology and data science** — interpreting data with a biologist’s intuition while developing robust analytical pipelines.
